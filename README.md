### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is [Zhiyang (Frank) Dou](https://frank-zy-dou.github.io/). 

I am an incoming Ph.D. student at [MIT CSAIL](https://www.csail.mit.edu/), supervised by [Prof. Wojciech Matusik](https://cdfg.mit.edu/wojciech). I will be affiliated with the [Computational Design and Fabrication Group](https://cdfg.mit.edu/) and the [Computer Graphics Group](https://graphics.csail.mit.edu/).

I will obtain my [MPhil](https://gradsch.hku.hk/prospective_students/programmes/master_of_philosophy) degree in the Computer Graphics Group at [The University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/), supervised by [Prof. Wenping Wang](https://www.cs.hku.hk/people/academic-staff/wenping) and [Prof. Taku Komura](https://www.cs.hku.hk/index.php/people/academic-staff/taku). I received my B.Eng. degree with honors from [Shandong University](https://www.en.sdu.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof. Shiqing Xin](http://irc.cs.sdu.edu.cn/~shiqing/index.html). I was a visiting scholar at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/), working with [Prof. Lingjie Liu](https://lingjie0206.github.io/) at the Graphics Lab and [GRASP Lab](https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/). I also collaborate closely with [Prof. Cynthia Sung](https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/people/cynthia-sung/) in the Department of Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mechanics at UPenn.

I am a member of AnySyn3D, where we create and build a realistic virtual world ðŸŒŽ.

**Research Interests**: Character Animation, Geometric Modeling and Processing, Simulation, Computer Graphics, Human Behavior Analysis (Capture, Modeling and Simulation).

I am receptive to engaging in discussions and exploring novel ideas. Please feel free to contact me (frankzydou@gmail.com).
